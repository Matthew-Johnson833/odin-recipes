    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p class="bigger">
        Hawaiian-style meatballs in a sweet, somewhat tangy sauce.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon ground ginger</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) can pineapple chunks, juice reserved</li>
        <li>1/3 cup water, or as needed</li>
        <h2>Sauce</h2>
        <li>1/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/4 cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tbsp soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Mix together ground beef, ginger, garlic powder, and pepper until well combined.
            Form into 1 1/2-inch meatballs.
        </li>
        <li>
            Saute meatballs in a large frying pan over medium-high heat until browned, about 10 minutes.
            Remove meatballs to a plate, reserving the pan drippings.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the meatballs are cooking, pour juice from the canned pineapple into a
                liquid measuring cup and add enough water to make 1 cup.
            Mix brown sugar and cornstarch in a small bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add pineapple juice and brown sugar mixtures to the warm pan drippings.
            Add vinegar and soy sauce and bring to a boil. Cook until sauce thickens, 2 to 3 minutes.
            Add meatballs, pineapple chunks, and green pepper. Simmer until meatballs are no longer pink inside, about 10 minutes.
        </li>
    </ol>
